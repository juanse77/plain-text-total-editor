# Plain Text Total Editor:

**Plain Text Total Editor** is designed to allow the creation and editing of plain text files. You can create files from scratch or open them in editing mode.

## Application behavior:
The formats it accepts are: TXT, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JSON, Python, Perl, C, C++, and MarkDown. The application does not perform validations on the structure of the document. Its operation is that of a basic notepad-type editor.

## Reading and writting:
The application can read documents in any path accessible from the device. Documents once edited can be saved. The files will be automatically saved in the *Download* folder, taking the name assigned in the application's text field.
During the saving process, the file name extension will be checked. If the extension matches one of those accepted by the application, the file will be stored with that name. If no extension is assigned, or the extension is not supported, the file will be created with a 'txt' extension. If a file with that name already exists, it will be rewritten..
